## Hook-flagged issues

When our PostToolUse hooks flag issues on files you touched (credo, format, dialyzer, etc.), fix them in this commit — including pre-existing flags unrelated to your change. See `critical-rules.md` → "FIX HOOK-FLAGGED ISSUES ON FILES YOU TOUCH". Touched-file scope only, not project-wide.
