<!--
Selective-load (Opus 4.8 — see setup-guide.md § "Skills vs Includes"):
the eager floor is critical-rules + harness-workflow.

Delegation is via the harness engine. harness-workflow.md is @-imported as the
portfolio-wide implement→review→land contract (cartouche is harness-driven);
the harness-driver skill stays skill-on-demand for the MCP/API surfaces. The
legacy Linear + Codex/Cursor stack is intentionally not loaded.

Everything else is skill-on-demand — Opus self-invokes when the situation
fires, and the hard parts are hook-enforced independently:
  worktree-workflow      → elixir:git-worktrees
  task-prioritization    → elixir:roadmap-planning
  task-writing           → task-driver:task-writing
  rmap                   → task-driver:rmap
  workflow-philosophy    → dev-lifecycle:workflow-philosophy
  code-style             → elixir:code-style
  development-philosophy → elixir:development-philosophy
  development-commands   → elixir:development-commands
  ex-unit-json           → elixir:ex-unit-json
  dialyzer-json          → elixir:dialyzer-json
  upstream-pr-workflow   → elixir:upstream-pr-workflow
  elixir-setup           → elixir:elixir-setup
  web-command / agent-economy / reach → elixir:*

Note: AGENTS.md is generated from this file (sync-agents-md.sh inlines the
@-imports) for any tool that reads the generic AGENTS.md convention but has no
skill system. We don't run Linear/Codex/Cursor cloud delegation here — harness
is the only dispatch path — so AGENTS.md has no cloud-agent consumer today;
it's kept as a low-cost convention surface. The Elixir convention set is also
enforced by the CI harness (.github/workflows/harness.yml).

## Hook-flagged issues

When our PostToolUse hooks flag issues on files you touched (credo, format, dialyzer, etc.), fix them in this commit — including pre-existing flags unrelated to your change. See `critical-rules.md` → "FIX HOOK-FLAGGED ISSUES ON FILES YOU TOUCH". Touched-file scope only, not project-wide.

## Sobelow workflow

After fixing a sobelow finding (or otherwise wanting to refresh `.sobelow-skips`), regenerate the suppression file from live state:

```bash
mix sobelow --mark-skip-all
```

That writes a fresh `.sobelow-skips` containing fingerprints for whatever sobelow flags right now. Resolved findings drop out automatically; new ones get added. Confirm with `mix sobelow` (clean output = all findings are accounted for).

`.sobelow-skips` is **tracked** — it is the project's accepted-pending-fix security baseline. Each fingerprint should map to a ROADMAP task that, when shipped, will resolve the finding (currently: Task 48 for the `Cartouche.Sleuth` `String.to_atom` cluster; Tasks 41/42/50/59-gen for the generator's `String.to_atom` and `File.{read!,mkdir_p!,write!}` paths). Fingerprints are deterministic (file:line + rule), so the file doesn't churn unless code or sobelow rules change. The CI harness (`.github/workflows/harness.yml`) runs `mix sobelow` against `.sobelow-conf` (`exit: "Low"`, `skip: true`) on every PR — without `.sobelow-skips` tracked, every CI run would fail on the accepted-pending-fix findings, so the file must be in version control. Don't hand-edit; regenerate via `mix sobelow --mark-skip-all` when fingerprints change.
