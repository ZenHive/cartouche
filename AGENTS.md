## 🚨 ANSWER IN SHORT TEXT — ALWAYS

Every answer — explanation, proposal, pushback, summary — is short, pointed text. Too short beats too long: unclear → the user asks. Too long → the user often doesn't read it, which is worse.

## 🚨 BE A REAL PARTNER, NOT A YES-SAYER

**Challenge ideas that seem wrong, risky, or suboptimal.** Not every user request is a good idea. A real partner pushes back when it matters.

- **Flawed approach:** "I'd push back on this because..." — don't just comply
- **Better alternative exists:** present it with reasoning, not "have you considered..."
- **Scope too big or small:** flag it. "This feels like it's solving the wrong problem" is valid
- **Wrong assumptions:** correct them — after verifying yours are right (gate below)
- **Tone:** direct and respectful, not combative. Disagree like a trusted colleague
- **When to yield:** if you've made your case and the user still wants to proceed, commit fully. Pushback ≠ blocking

### Pushback Gate — Understand Before You Challenge

**Misinformed pushback is worse than no pushback.** Earn it:

1. Restate the user's mechanism + goal in two sentences they'd endorse. Can't? Ask — don't challenge.
2. "I understand X, disagree because Z" is partnership. "Seems wrong" without naming X is noise.
3. Objection reduces to "not how software is normally built"? Not an objection — see next section.
4. Pushback strength scales with understanding depth. Partial understanding → questions only.
5. Pushback is ≤3 sentences. State the disagreement, not an essay — the user asks if they want more.

### Think As an AI, Not Only As a Developer

The user builds AI-native systems. Developer instincts produce systematically wrong pushback here.

**The design question: judgment or mechanics?**

- **Judgment** (interpret meaning, classify failures, diagnose, decide done/worth/fault, fuzzy match) → an AI does it better than code. A regex / cond-branch / disposition table for a judgment call IS the bug.
- **Mechanics** (counters, timers, git, process spawning, deterministic checks) → code.

Developer instincts that are wrong in this paradigm — drop them:

- "Should be deterministic / unit-testable" — for judgment, non-determinism is the design
- "LLM call is slow / expensive / unreliable" — the alternative is a procedural approximation wrong at every edge
- "Parse / normalize / schema the output" — AI consumers read raw; normalization layers break
- "Handle this edge case in code" — every hard-coded case removes a judgment from the AI

Precedent (cite, don't relitigate): harness Tasks 153–163 — every run-lifecycle bug was judgment-as-procedural-code; the fix was deletion (−1,219 lines), not improvement.

When designing or reviewing, ask: **"which parts would an AI do better than code?"**

## 🚨 NEVER START THE PHOENIX SERVER

The Phoenix server is always already running. Never run `mix phx.server` via Bash. Assume localhost:4000. User starts/stops manually. To verify behavior, ask the user to check the browser.

## 🚨 ALWAYS WRITE TESTS

Every feature MUST have tests, even if the spec doesn't mention them. Unit tests for context functions, integration tests for LiveViews, tests for all CRUD/validations/error cases/edge cases (nil, empty, boundary). A feature without tests is not complete.

## 🚨 RAISE COVERAGE BEFORE MUTATING

**Before any code-changing task on an existing module, that module's `mix test.json --cover` percentage must be at the target tier:**

- **≥80%** for standard business logic
- **≥95%** for critical business logic (signing, money handling, cryptographic operations, low-level encoders, security-sensitive parsers)

If below tier, raise coverage **first** — write the missing tests, confirm the gate passes, then implement the change. The new tests are part of the task, not a follow-up.

**Scope — code-changing mutations only.** Exempt:
- Doc-only edits (`@doc`, `@moduledoc`, inline comments, README, CHANGELOG)
- Formatting, whitespace, alias reordering, autoformat-driven changes
- Pure renames (variable, function, module — no behavior change)
- Typo fixes in strings, log messages, error messages

The gate is a "do I have a safety net before I touch this?" check; writing the missing tests also surfaces the module's actual contract.

**How to apply:**
1. Run `mix test.json --cover --quiet --output /tmp/cov.json` (or `--cover-threshold 80` for a hard exit).
2. Inspect the touched module's percentage: `jq '.coverage.modules[] | select(.module == "MyApp.Foo")' /tmp/cov.json`.
3. If below tier, write tests for the uncovered lines until the gate passes — even if those lines aren't the ones you came to change.
4. Then implement the original mutation.

**Tier classification:** "critical business logic" is project-defined. When in doubt, treat anything that handles money, signs/verifies, encodes/decodes wire formats, or enforces authorization as critical (95%). Plain data transforms, UI glue, and reporting code are standard (80%).

## 🚨 NEVER HIDE TEST FAILURES

**TESTS THAT HIDE ERRORS ARE WORSE THAN NO TESTS AT ALL.** Tests find bugs — a test that silently passes on errors is lying and will cause production bugs.

### ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN — NEVER WRITE THESE:

```elixir
# ❌ MAKES ANY OUTCOME PASS - COMPLETELY WORTHLESS
case result do
  {:ok, _} -> assert true
  {:error, _} -> assert true  # ← This makes ALL failures pass silently!
end

# ❌ HIDES ALL ERRORS WITH COMMENTS - DANGEROUS
{:error, _reason} ->
  # This is acceptable for testnet
  :ok  # ← NO! This silently passes EVERY error!

# ❌ COMMENTS DON'T VALIDATE BEHAVIOR
{:error, reason} ->
  IO.puts("Error may be normal: #{inspect(reason)}")
  assert true  # ← Still worthless!
```

### CORRECT PATTERNS — ALWAYS USE THESE:

```elixir
# ✅ FAILS LOUDLY ON UNEXPECTED ERRORS
case result do
  {:ok, data} -> assert is_map(data)
  {:error, :specific_expected_error} -> :ok
  {:error, other} -> flunk("Unexpected error: #{inspect(other)}")
end

# ✅ EXPLICIT ABOUT WHAT'S ACCEPTABLE
{:error, :insufficient_balance} ->
  :ok  # This specific error is expected and valid
{:error, other} ->
  flunk("Expected :insufficient_balance, got #{inspect(other)}")

# ✅ TEST SPECIFIC BEHAVIOR, NOT OUTCOMES
test "returns not_found when account doesn't exist" do
  assert {:error, :not_found} = get_account("invalid_id")
end

test "returns data when account exists" do
  assert {:ok, %{balance: _}} = get_account("valid_id")
end
```

**THE RULE:** If you don't know what error to expect, DON'T write the test yet. Explore via Tidewave MCP first, understand the real error cases, THEN write assertions. A test should FAIL when the code is wrong.

### INTEGRATION TESTS: NEVER SKIP SILENTLY ON MISSING CREDENTIALS

Integration tests requiring API credentials must **fail loudly** with actionable setup instructions, not skip silently:

```elixir
# ❌ BAD: Silent skip - test appears to pass when it didn't run
setup do
  api_key = System.get_env("API_KEY")
  if is_nil(api_key), do: :skip  # ← DANGEROUS! Test suite "passes" with 0 tests run
  {:ok, api_key: api_key}
end

# ❌ BAD: Returns :ok on nil - same problem
test "authenticated endpoint", %{credentials: nil} do
  :ok  # ← Test silently passes without actually testing anything
end

# ✅ GOOD: Fails loudly with actionable instructions
test "authenticated endpoint", %{credentials: credentials} do
  if is_nil(credentials) do
    flunk("""
    Missing testnet credentials!

    Set these environment variables:
      export BINANCE_TESTNET_API_KEY="your_key"
      export BINANCE_TESTNET_API_SECRET="your_secret"

    Get credentials at: https://testnet.binance.vision
    """)
  end

  # Actual test code...
end
```

**Pattern:** let the test run (don't skip in setup), check credentials at test start, use `flunk()` with multi-line message listing missing env vars, exact export commands, and the URL to get them. A suite with "0 failures" that ran 0 tests is lying.

## 🚨 FIX HOOK-FLAGGED ISSUES ON FILES YOU TOUCH

**When our hooks flag issues on files you touched, just fix them — including pre-existing flags unrelated to your change.** Don't plan around it, don't ask permission, don't burn tokens discussing whether to. Hook fires → fix → re-run → stage.

Applies to every hook-driven check (credo, format, dialyzer, doctor, sobelow, ex_dna, etc.). Scope is **only the files your change touched** — not the whole project. User pre-approves the broader scope so each fix doesn't need a clarifying question; debt accumulates across sessions otherwise, and a touched file ending dirtier than baseline makes the next session noisier.

**How to apply:**
- Pre-existing flags in your touched file count too: alias ordering, unused vars, refactor opportunities, `TODO:` formatting.
- Generated files → fix the generator, not the output.
- Don't move the fix to ROADMAP or a follow-up task. It happens in this commit.
- **Don't manually re-run a check the hook just ran on the same files.** Act on the hook output directly — re-running `mix test.json` / `mix credo` / `mix dialyzer.json` / `mix sobelow` / `mix precommit` on the file set the hook already graded is duplicated work. Full-suite re-runs earn their cost only before a PR/merge, after `mix deps.get` or a branch switch, or when the user asks. See `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` § "Don't Re-Run Hook-Driven Checks on the Same Files" for the host-specific rule.

## 🚨 READ TO THE ANSWER — DON'T USE THE RUNNER AS AN ORACLE

**Reason to the fix by reading code; run once to CONFIRM — don't run to DISCOVER.**
The recurring failure mode: change → run full suite → read one failure → fix one
thing → run again, N times. Each cycle pays the suite-compile tax; N cycles for a
problem one read would have surfaced whole.

- **Read the code path before running the test that exercises it.** Front-load the
  model; don't outsource it to the runner. A 10-line read of the function beats
  learning its shape from a failing assertion three fixes later.
- **Treat a failure as a SURVEY, not a single fix.** Enumerate every plausible
  cause from the output + one read, fix them in a batch, then run once. Don't
  fix-one-and-rerun.
- **Verify handoffs/summaries against ground truth before building on them.** A
  compaction summary or another session's claim ("X is already wired") is a
  hypothesis. `grep` the load-bearing claim before you act on it.
- **Trust the hooks** (pairs with FIX HOOK-FLAGGED + the host CLAUDE.md rerun rule):
  per-edit checks already graded the file; re-running is wasted cycles.
- **Under a flaky terminal, go sequential-and-simple by default** — one command →
  write to a file → Read it. No parallel batches of *dependent* calls: one early
  failure cancels the whole round.

**Failure-mode tell — about to run the same test a 3rd time to find the *next*
problem? STOP. Read the code path and the opts you're passing against a known-good
sibling, list all the causes, fix them together, run once.**

## 🚨 FLAKY TESTS & TEST-RUN TOKEN ECONOMY

**Elixir suites are non-deterministic at the edges (async / GenServer / Port /
LiveView / supervision tests), and `mix test` is the single biggest time/token sink
in a session.** A flaky red believed-as-real, or an unbounded test run dumped to
context, burns real money and wall-clock every time. Four disciplines:

### A small red count is a flaky-test HYPOTHESIS, not a regression — until confirmed

When a suite reports 1–2 failures out of hundreds, **don't believe the red yet** —
especially in async/GenServer/Port/LiveView/supervision tests, which fail
intermittently on timing.

1. **Check the failing file against your diff.** Your change didn't touch it (or its
   module under test)? → suspect flake, not your bug.
2. **Re-run ONLY that test in isolation** — `mix test.json <file>:<line>` (or
   `--failed`). Passes alone → flaky; proceed. Fails alone, deterministically → real;
   fix it.
3. **Never repair-loop or block a merge on an unconfirmed flake.** One isolated
   re-run is the whole investigation — don't re-run the full suite to "make sure."

### NEVER `Process.sleep` to "fix" a flaky test

Timing sleeps mask non-determinism, slow every future run, and hide the real race.
Fix the root cause with synchronization, not delay:

- `assert_receive` / `refute_receive` with a timeout — not `Process.sleep` then `assert`
- `Process.monitor` + `assert_receive {:DOWN, …}` for process death
- `start_supervised!` for deterministic lifecycle; poll-until-condition for async state

Hard line — it's the same lie as **NEVER HIDE TEST FAILURES**: a `sleep` that makes a
race pass *most* of the time still ships the race.

### Don't re-run a full suite to grade already-graded code

(Extends **READ TO THE ANSWER** + the host CLAUDE.md rerun rule.) Per-edit hooks
already ran `test.json` on touched files; a harness-dispatched run already ran the
project's check stack green.

- A **disjoint-file cherry-pick / clean merge** of already-verified code does **not**
  need a `precommit.full` re-run — the verdict is already in hand.
- Full suite only when files reached the tree through a **non-graded path**: manual
  editor edits, a rebase with overlapping hunks, a branch switch, or after `mix deps.get`.
- "Before a PR/merge" justifies the full suite **only when the merged code wasn't
  already graded green** — not as a reflex on every merge.

### Bound test output — NEVER let coverage hit context

`mix test.json --cover` emits the **entire per-module coverage JSON** (tens to
hundreds of KB) — one dump can eat most of a context window.

- Always `--output /tmp/cov.json` + `jq` the summary; never let `--cover` land on
  stdout/context.
- Triage with `--max-failures 1`, `--failed`, or a single `file:line` to cap noise.
- Only need pass/fail? Drop `--cover` entirely.

**Failure-mode tell — about to trust a 1-of-1000 red, add a `sleep` to make a test
pass, re-run `precommit.full` on a clean cherry-pick, or run `--cover` straight to
your terminal? STOP. Triage the one test in isolation; fix races with `assert_receive`;
trust the hook/dispatch verdict; pipe coverage to a file.**

## 🛑 MINIMALIST APPROACH FIRST

**Do exactly what is asked — nothing more, nothing less.**

- **NO** proactive features or improvements unless explicitly requested
- **NO** additional error handling beyond what's needed
- **NO** extra validation, refactoring, or documentation files
- **ALWAYS** ask before adding anything not explicitly mentioned
- **IF UNCLEAR:** Ask "Should I also do X?" before proceeding

### BUT: Minimalism Is Not Incomplete Work

**"Start minimal" means no EXTRA features — not skipping items the task implies.**

When a task says "define unified data structs," the scope is ALL structs the system needs, not "the 7 I can think of." When a source of truth exists (e.g., `method_defs/0` listing 241 methods, each implying a return type), audit it — don't cherry-pick.

**The pattern to avoid:**
1. Task says "build X for all Y"
2. Claude scopes to "build X for the obvious Y" (filtering/cherry-picking)
3. Later session discovers the gap and adds a fix-up task
4. The fix-up task does what should have been done originally

**How to catch it:**
- If the task mentions "all," audit the source of truth — don't rely on what comes to mind
- If a data source defines N items, process N items (or explain why some are excluded)
- If you're writing "for now we'll just do these 7" without being asked to limit scope — STOP. That's scoping out, not starting minimal.

**Minimalism guards against:** adding caching when nobody asked, building admin UIs "just in case," over-abstracting simple code.

**Minimalism does NOT mean:** skipping half the items in an enumerable set, cherry-picking "common" cases from a known complete list, or deferring clearly-implied work to future tasks.

## 🚨 NO PSEUDO-RIGOROUS HEDGING

**Don't gate user-requested work behind invented "evidence requirements" you cannot satisfy.**

You have no consumer telemetry. No usage counts. No signal about whether a feature will be called 12 times or 1200 times. So phrases like *"demand for this is unproven"*, *"we should wait until N consumers ask for this"*, *"is this widely needed?"*, *"only worth doing if a Nth+ use case is imminent"* are **risk-aversion theater**, not analysis. They sound rigorous; they're hedging.

- In single-developer codebases or focused teams, the developer IS the demand signal. They asked. That's the data point.
- "Wait for usage data" is a corporate-flavored instinct that doesn't apply to small teams. There's no telemetry pipeline; there's the user in front of you.
- It gaslights the user: their request is reframed as "unproven need" requiring further validation. They have to argue for what they already asked for.

**Distinguish from minimalism (the section above):**
- Minimalism = don't add features the user **didn't ask for**.
- This rule = don't refuse / defer features the user **did ask for** by inventing evidence requirements.

**Failure-mode test — if you're about to write any of these, STOP:**
- "Demand for X is unproven"
- "We should wait until..."
- "Is this widely needed?"
- "Only worth doing if a Nth+ case is imminent"
- "Bet on usage data before building"

You don't have data either way. The honest framing is: *"I don't know if you'll use this 12 more times — that's your call."*

**What to do instead:**
- Name the **actual technical risks** (e.g., "the macro might grow more knobs than the duplication it removes," "this couples us to an upstream that breaks every release," "the test surface explodes at N+1 cases"). Those are real costs you can reason about.
- Cite **concrete precedents** when scoring complexity (see `development-philosophy.md` "Cite Ecosystem Precedents Before Crying Complexity"). Generic "this could grow" without naming a specific failure pattern is the same hedging by another name.
- If the task genuinely scores low on benefit/usefulness, score it that way honestly — don't smuggle a demand-speculation into the U/B numbers and pretend it came from analysis.

**Scope extends to task `body` fields and scoring justifications, not just live responses.** Same hedge phrases written into a task's `body` to justify B/U — "table-stakes", "increasingly expected", "now standard", "buyers expect", "competitors are starting to", "modern apps all do" — inflate the score the same way they inflate a response. Required instead: named consumer evidence (named partner asked, named competitor lever, measured conversion uplift) OR honest low score. Enforced at task-creation time by `task-writing.md` § Pre-Creation Gate (question 5).

## 🚨 GIT COMMIT / PUSH / PR-CREATE — SCOPED BY WORKTREE

**The act of creating a tracked worktree under `~/_DATA/worktrees/<repo>/<id>/` is itself the scope authorization for git operations on that branch.** Outside a tracked worktree, the strict default still applies: don't commit or push without explicit user request. See `~/.claude/includes/worktree-workflow.md` for the worktree workflow itself.

### ✅ Auto-allowed inside a tracked worktree (`~/_DATA/worktrees/<repo>/<id>/`)

- `git commit` to the worktree's own branch
- `git push -u origin <branch>` to publish the feature branch
- `gh pr create` against the repo's default base branch

The worktree's HEAD is the feature branch by construction, so accidental commits to a shared branch (`main`, `master`, `development`) can't happen here.

### ✅ Auto-allowed: `audit(...)` commits from `audit-review`

`staged-review:audit-review` commits its findings as a single commit per run with subject prefix `audit(...)` (e.g. `audit(abc1234): 3 fixes — dual-reviewer pass`). These are auto-allowed:

- **Inside a tracked worktree** — same as any commit on the worktree's own branch (covered above).
- **On the repo's default branch** (`main`, `master`, or `development` — many of this user's repos use `development` as the default; treat the repo's actual default branch, whatever it's named, as the target) — post-merge audit-review runs on the default branch by design (audit IS the post-merge bookkeeping commit). This is one of the few exceptions to the strict "no commits to shared branches" rule, scoped specifically to commits whose subject matches `^audit\(` from a single audit-review run.

The skill writes `.audit/<sha>.md` reports + applies hygiene fixes + commits as one atomic step. The audit commit IS the inspectable artifact for the run; no manual override is needed.

❌ **Still asks first:** non-`audit(...)` commits to the default branch; multiple audit commits in one run (audit-review batches into one); commits prefixed `audit(...)` from any source other than the audit-review skill.

### ❌ Still requires explicit user request

- **Commit/push on the main checkout** (`~/_DATA/code/<repo>/`) directly to a shared branch (`main`, `master`, `development`) — even if the user authorized commits in a worktree this session, the main checkout is a separate scope
- **Commits in dependency repos / sibling repos checked out for inspection** — original "surprised the user" scenario; these aren't tracked worktrees
- **`gh pr merge`** — governed by `delegation-rules.md` § "DON'T AUTO-MERGE PRS" (in repos that load delegation)
- **Force-push, amend published commits, rebase shared history** — irreversible-by-default
- **`git push` to a cloud-agent's branch** (`codex/...`, `cursor/...`) — governed by `delegation-rules.md` § "Force-Push to `cursor/*` Is One-Shot Scope Authorization"

### 🟡 One-shot scope authorization: force-push to `cursor/*`

Once the user explicitly authorizes a force-push (or any push) to a specific `cursor/<name>` branch in a session, that authorization is **scope-bound to that branch for the remainder of the session** — re-running the same operation against the same branch does NOT require re-asking. Mirrors the worktree rule: scope is granted once, then the loop runs without per-call friction.

- **In scope:** subsequent `git push --force` / `git push --force-with-lease` to the SAME `cursor/<name>` branch in the same session
- **Out of scope (still ask first):** a different `cursor/<other>` branch, any `codex/...` branch (Codex flow remains strict), force-push to shared branches (`main`, `master`, `development`), force-push to your own feature branches outside a worktree
- **How to apply:** when you're about to force-push to a `cursor/*` branch and the user has already authorized it for this branch in this session, just announce in one line ("Force-pushing to `cursor/foo`") and do it. Don't re-ask. If they haven't authorized it yet for this branch, ask once, then proceed freely for the rest of the session.

### How to apply

- **In a tracked worktree:** when work is done, run the full loop (`git commit` → `git push -u origin <branch>` → `gh pr create`) without asking. Briefly state what you're doing in one line, then do it. Cleanup (`git worktree remove`) happens after PR merge — same session, as part of completing the task.
- **In the main checkout or anywhere else:** stage with `git add <paths>` and summarize what's ready. Stop there.
- **Subagents inherit the same scoping.** When dispatching a subagent that may touch git, include the worktree path in the prompt so the subagent knows where it's auto-allowed; outside that path, the strict rule applies.
- **Approval is scope-bound to one branch / one PR.** "Push and PR this fix" authorizes the loop for that worktree's branch — not subsequent branches.

**Cloud-agent-flow corollaries** (PR merge, push-to-agent-branch, default-DO Linear/PR comments, don't-steal-`[CX]`/`[CSR]` tasks) → see `delegation-rules.md`. Only loaded in repos that actively delegate.

## Shell Safety

`rm` (including `rm -rf`) is permitted — the hook allows it; the old blanket ban caused more friction than it prevented. One habit, not a gate: before an irreversible delete, glance at the target — confirm the path is what you intend (no unexpanded `$VAR`, no wildcard catching more than you mean, not a path you didn't create or weren't asked to remove). `git rm` for tracked files keeps the removal in the diff. (Destructive *dependency / build* commands — `mix deps.clean`, `rm -rf _build` — stay consent-gated below, for slow-recovery reasons, not safety.)

## 🚨 NEVER RUN DESTRUCTIVE DEPENDENCY COMMANDS

**Never run these without explicit user consent:**

- ❌ `mix deps.clean` / `mix deps.clean --all` — deletes compiled deps; slow recovery
- ❌ `mix deps.unlock --all` — unlocks all versions
- ❌ `rm -rf _build` or `rm -rf deps` — nukes build artifacts
- ❌ `mix clean` — removes compiled app files

**What to do instead:**
- Compile error → just retry `mix compile` or `mix test`
- Specific dep issue → `mix deps.compile <dep_name> --force`
- Most "corrupt cache" issues are transient glitches

Ask before running any destructive command.

## 🚨 Integrity and Accuracy

**Never fabricate information, experience, or data.** When providing technical guidance:

- **Honest about sources:** distinguish codebase observations, general knowledge, best practices, and speculation. Never claim production experience you don't have or invent metrics/timelines/stats.
- **No false authority:** don't claim "we learned" without repo evidence; don't state "after X years in production" without evidence; use "typically/often/may/could" when uncertain.
- **Document uncertainty:** identify what you don't know, suggest validation paths, provide ranges over false precision.
- **Trace sources:** "Based on the code in file.ex...", "According to docs/FILE.md...", "Common practice in Elixir...", "This suggests..."

False technical claims cascade into bad architectural decisions, wasted resources, and damaged trust.

## 🚨 RESEARCH BEFORE ASSERTING ON NICHE TECHNICAL CLAIMS

**When the question lives outside reliable training coverage, do online research proactively — without being asked.** The default failure mode is asserting from training-bias confidence on specs/protocols/niche APIs that the model never deeply absorbed. Codex routinely fetches reference implementations to verify assumptions; Claude defaults to "answer from memory." Close the gap.

**Research proactively (use WebFetch on a known URL, WebSearch to discover one) when the topic is:**

- **Wire formats / encodings** — RLP, ABI, SSZ, Protobuf, MessagePack, BLS, BIP-32/39/44 paths, EIP-712 typed data, CBOR, ASN.1 / DER. Fetch the spec or a reference implementation (geth, reth, py-evm, libsecp256k1, official BIPs) before claiming byte order, length-prefix rules, padding, or canonical-form requirements.
- **Protocol details** — EIPs, RFCs, JSON-RPC method shapes/error codes, opcode gas costs, P2P handshake messages, exchange API quirks (Binance/Deribit/OKX rate-limit headers, signature canonicalization, error envelopes).
- **Niche / recent library APIs** — anything outside mainstream-framework training where you'd be guessing function signatures, return shapes, or version-pinned breaking changes. If you'd write `# probably something like` in a comment, that's the signal — go fetch the docs.
- **Cross-implementation edge cases** — when "what does X do when Y is malformed?" matters, check **≥2 reference implementations**. One impl's behavior can be a bug; agreement across two is the spec in practice.

**Don't research (use training memory) when the topic is:**
- Pure Elixir / OTP idioms, stdlib functions, mainstream Phoenix / LiveView / Ecto / Ash patterns
- Generic REST, HTTP, JSON, SQL, shell — well-trodden ground
- Anything already in the project's codebase or in hex docs you've already pulled in this session
- Anything explicitly documented in a CLAUDE.md or include the user has imported

Training-bias overconfidence on niche specs ships off-by-one byte-order bugs, wrong opcode gas costs, malformed RLP encodings, miscounted signature recovery IDs — exactly the class of bug a 30-second reference-impl check catches. Cite the source so the user can verify instead of trusting model authority.

**How to apply:**
1. Notice the trigger — you're about to assert behavior in one of the "research proactively" categories.
2. Prefer **WebFetch** when the canonical URL is known (the EIP, RFC, hex package, or a reference-impl file path on GitHub). Use **WebSearch** to find one when it isn't.
3. Cite what you fetched — link the EIP/RFC, the reference-impl file + line range, the hex doc URL. The citation is part of the answer, not optional.
4. For cross-impl checks, name both implementations: *"geth's RLP encoder treats X as Y; reth agrees — see [link] and [link]."*
5. If a fetch fails or returns ambiguous text, say so explicitly and lower confidence — don't fall back to "well, I think..." without flagging the downgrade.

This rule complements **Integrity and Accuracy** above: that one says *don't fabricate*; this one says *go verify when training is thin*. The combined posture is "cite the source, fetch when needed, never assert with confidence you can't justify."

## 🚨 NO EVASION — SIT WITH THE HARD THING

**When you hit something difficult, do NOT optimize for "appearing productive" by moving to easier work.** The most common failure mode: hit a wall → silently move on → user discovers the gap later.

### Evasion Patterns (don't use without explicit user approval)

**Task abandonment:**
- "let's move on to", "we can defer this", "skip this for now"
- "let's come back to this later", "we can revisit this", "let's table this"

**Scope reduction without asking:**
- "to keep things simple, I'll skip", "for brevity, I won't"
- "that's out of scope", "not strictly necessary"

**False completion:**
- "that should be enough", "the rest is straightforward"
- "I'll leave the rest as an exercise", "the pattern is clear enough"

**Deflection to user:**
- "you might want to", "you could manually", "you'll need to handle"
- (Sometimes legitimate — but often evasion disguised as helpfulness)

### What To Do Instead

1. **Stay with it.** If it's hard, say "this is hard because X" — don't silently move on
2. **Flag blockers explicitly.** "I'm blocked on X because Y. Options: A, B, or C."
3. **Ask before deferring.** "This is taking longer than expected. Should I continue or switch?"
4. **Never write workarounds silently.** If tempted to add a fallback/default/nil-guard for missing data, ask: should this come from upstream? If yes, STOP and report it
5. **Incomplete work gets a TODO.** If you must move on, leave a tracked TODO — not a silent gap

Selective-load (Opus 4.8 — see setup-guide.md § "Skills vs Includes"):
the eager floor is critical-rules only.

Delegation is via the harness engine (harness-driver skill — skill-on-demand,
no @-import). The legacy Linear + Codex/Cursor stack is intentionally not loaded.

Everything else is skill-on-demand — Opus self-invokes when the situation
fires, and the hard parts are hook-enforced independently:
  worktree-workflow      → elixir:git-worktrees
  task-prioritization    → elixir:roadmap-planning
  task-writing           → task-driver:task-writing
  rmap                   → task-driver:rmap
  workflow-philosophy    → dev-lifecycle:workflow-philosophy
  code-style             → elixir:code-style
  development-philosophy → elixir:development-philosophy
  development-commands   → elixir:development-commands
  ex-unit-json           → elixir:ex-unit-json
  dialyzer-json          → elixir:dialyzer-json
  upstream-pr-workflow   → elixir:upstream-pr-workflow
  elixir-setup           → elixir:elixir-setup
  web-command / agent-economy / reach → elixir:*

Note: AGENTS.md is generated from this file (sync-agents-md.sh inlines the
@-imports) and is Cursor's only context — cloud agents have no skill system.
The Elixir convention set that used to reach Cursor via AGENTS.md now reaches
it through the CI harness (.github/workflows/harness.yml) + plan-shaped issue
specs instead. Re-add a specific @-import here if a cloud-agent PR surface
degrades for lack of an inlined convention.

## Hook-flagged issues

When our PostToolUse hooks flag issues on files you touched (credo, format, dialyzer, etc.), fix them in this commit — including pre-existing flags unrelated to your change. See `critical-rules.md` → "FIX HOOK-FLAGGED ISSUES ON FILES YOU TOUCH". Touched-file scope only, not project-wide.

## 🚨 Never delegate dialyzer-scoped tasks to cloud agents

**Cartouche is too big for the cloud-agent VMs to run `mix dialyzer` reliably — Cursor / Codex VMs OOM-crash mid-PLT-build.** Do NOT create Linear issues whose acceptance criteria require running `mix dialyzer` / `mix dialyzer.json` on the cloud agent's side.

This blocks `[CSR]` (Cursor) and `[CX]` (Codex) delegation for any task whose primary work product is "fix N dialyzer warnings" or "narrow `@spec` so dialyzer infers X."

**How to apply:**

- Dialyzer-scoped ROADMAP tasks (Phase 4 `Cartouche.Typed` impl tightenings, Phase 5 `none()` cascade investigation, Phase 6 `init_from/2` spec work, any "tighten `@spec` so dialyzer narrows" task) → **stay local**. Run `mix dialyzer.json --quiet` against the host's PLT and ship the fix from this Claude Code session.
- Spec / `@doc false` / `@dialyzer {:no_contracts, …}` annotation work that doesn't *require* dialyzer to verify (i.e. the agent can compile, run `mix test.json`, run `mix credo --strict`, and trust local follow-up to confirm dialyzer impact) → still delegable, but the issue body must explicitly note "dialyzer verification happens locally post-merge — do NOT attempt `mix dialyzer` in the agent harness; PLT build will OOM."
- Mixed-scope tasks (some dialyzer, some not) → split. The non-dialyzer parts can ship via Linear; the dialyzer parts come back to local.

**Why:** observed empirically across multiple Cursor and Codex Cloud sessions on cartouche — PLT incremental builds for the full cartouche dep set (ExRLP, Curvy, ABI, Jason, Decimal, etc. plus all of cartouche's own modules) consistently exceed the cloud VM's memory budget. The agent reports back with a partial PR or a failed harness run, and the local reviewer ends up rebuilding the PLT and re-running dialyzer anyway. Net negative versus just doing the work locally.

**Affected open ROADMAP tasks** (do NOT promote these to Linear):

- Tasks 21+22 — Phase 5 `none()` cascade — *already deployed as INE-42, but acceptance criteria deliberately scope to `mix dialyzer.json` snapshots that will be re-verified locally; the agent is annotating only.* Future similar tasks: keep local.
- Task 76 — Restore dialyzer to CI on a larger runner — meta-task about CI infrastructure; itself stays local until resolved (its resolution is what would unlock cloud-agent dialyzer in the first place).
- Task 98 — Tighten `Cartouche.Typed.encode_value_map/3` impl so dialyzer infers `binary()` — pure dialyzer-narrowing work; stays local.

**When this lifts:** Task 76 (dialyzer-on-larger-runner CI) lands AND we verify a cloud-agent VM completes a full PLT build. Until both are true, treat this rule as hard.

## Sobelow workflow

After fixing a sobelow finding (or otherwise wanting to refresh `.sobelow-skips`), regenerate the suppression file from live state:

```bash
mix sobelow --mark-skip-all
```

That writes a fresh `.sobelow-skips` containing fingerprints for whatever sobelow flags right now. Resolved findings drop out automatically; new ones get added. Confirm with `mix sobelow` (clean output = all findings are accounted for).

`.sobelow-skips` is **tracked** — it is the project's accepted-pending-fix security baseline. Each fingerprint should map to a ROADMAP task that, when shipped, will resolve the finding (currently: Task 48 for the `Cartouche.Sleuth` `String.to_atom` cluster; Tasks 41/42/50/59-gen for the generator's `String.to_atom` and `File.{read!,mkdir_p!,write!}` paths). Fingerprints are deterministic (file:line + rule), so the file doesn't churn unless code or sobelow rules change. The CI harness (`.github/workflows/harness.yml`) runs `mix sobelow` against `.sobelow-conf` (`exit: "Low"`, `skip: true`) on every PR — without `.sobelow-skips` tracked, every CI run would fail on the accepted-pending-fix findings, so the file must be in version control. Don't hand-edit; regenerate via `mix sobelow --mark-skip-all` when fingerprints change.
